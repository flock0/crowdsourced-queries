## How to compile and create JAR-file

Run `mvn package`, this will download the dependencies, compile the code and
create the JAR-file `target/crowdsourced-1-jar-with-dependencies.jar`. This
JAR-file contains all the dependencies thus you can execute it on any computer.

## How to run

Run `java -jar target/crowdsourced-1-jar-with-dependencies.jar`

You need to create a credentials.txt containing your AMT account informations. To do so:

    cp credentials.example.txt credentials.txt
    editor credentials.txt

And replace each line with the relevant information. For instance, the content could be:

    ABCDEFGHIJKLM1234567
    Long/s3rE7-2334
    0
